    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Momos are a type of steamed filled dumpling in Tibetan and Nepali cuisine that is also popular in neighbouring Bhutan, Bangladesh, and India</p>
    <p>Momos are usually served with a sauce known as achar influenced by the spices and herbs used within many South Asian cuisines. It can also be used in soup, as in jhol momo and mokthuk. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Two onions</li>
        <li>Two inches fresh ginger</li>
        <li>Two or three cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>A bunch of cilantro</li>
        <li>One pound of cabbage</li>
        <li>One pound of tofu</li>
        <li>One quarter pound of dark brown mushrooms</li>
        <li>Two tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
        <li>One teaspoon of chicken or vegetable bouillon</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Make your filling, roll out the wrappers and stuff them.</li>
        <li> Place the stuffed momos on a silicone lined baking sheet in rows, making sure none of the pieces touch each other. Cover the tray with a clean, wet towel as you prep to prevent them from drying out.</li>
        <li>Once all your momos are ready, place the tray straight into the freezer and freeze for 1-2 hours.</li>
        <li>Transfer the frozen momos to a ziplock bag after divding them to into smaller portion. This why you can pull out only one bag at a time to prevent the rest from going bad.</li>
        <li> When you are ready to cook, just place the frozen momos straight into the steamer and steam for an extra minute or two. There is no need to defrost them first</li>
    </ol>
